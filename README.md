User Story:
As a user, I want to know how to play the game. I want to be able to hit start to begin the game as well as having the ability exit the game while playing if I want to. I want enough variety for the people I will be kissing, killing and maybe marrying. I want some sort of result accoring to my choices display at the end of the game. Overall, I want the game to be super simple and light hearted. Something to do with friends to pass time by.

How to play:
Every turn you will get a profile. You get to pick if you want to kiss, kill or marry them by clicking the button(s). You have certain amount of turn allocated before the game end. 
Remember, whoever you choose to marry last at the end of the round is who you will see if it works out.

Technologies used:
CSS
HTML
Javascript
JQuery

In this game, there is not a specific win or loose state. The idea of win and loose state are based out of what the user wants and things out of the user control. This allows the game to be determined by randomization and characters life choice (the people from the profiles), meaning less creator bias. The game outline is continuous for this reason. The reason Is simplicity for user. It also allows user to track their activities on the game. The game approach is simplicity.

Challenges:
The main challenge in the game is to pick someone you like as a user for the person you want to marry before your last round. This mean users are facing choice constraint as well as being satisfied with their choice. Secondly, at the end of the game another challenge out of user control pops up. Which is whether the person they want to marry is available for the union.
